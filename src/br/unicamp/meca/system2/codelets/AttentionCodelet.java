/**
 * This class represents the MECA Attention Codelet in System 2. Beware that
 * there is also an Attention Codelet in MECA's System 1. The System 2
 * Specification in MECA includes the definition of an Episodic Subsystem,
 * responsible for higher-level perception with the tracking of time along
 * Perceptual Memory and with the aid of Attention Codelets discover and detect
 * the formation of episodes, and the storage and recovering of these episodes
 * in the Episodic Memory.
 * <p>
 * Usually, Attention Codelet in System 2 are application-specific, and the MECA
 * software implementation just provides basic template class, which is a
 * wrapper to CST's {@link Codelet}, to be reused while building an application
 * using MECA.
